                      Reaching the top of Ambuluwawa one can experience the most amazing views which could sometimes be covered by the ongoing mist. However, once the mist clears off the view can be scary and freak out climbers, especially those who have a fear of heights. Do note that hiking Ambuluwawa is not at all dangerous or risky, but it would not be the ideal kind of adventure for those with a fear of heights.
