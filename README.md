  Many visitors from several countries come to watch beautiful and ancient places in Sri Lanka. From those  who come to visit Sri Lanka, many of them don’t know much about anything in this country. So if they aren’t with any guide they could face inconveniences and may be cheated.

  It is possible to overcome this problem by developing a website which provides details about the places, accommodations, food facilities, cab services to the users of the website, so people can view those details and search for relevant locations and people can book hotels or accommodations and order foods using the system.
